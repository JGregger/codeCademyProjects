# Dog-Years
The project on codecademy for calculating "dog years" from human years.

let myAge = 15;
//Setting to my age
let earlyYears = 2;
//Setting early years of life value
earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;
//Multiplying and reassigning years
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
//Factoring in change in time of early years
laterYears = laterYears * 4;
// Calculating dog years in later life
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
//Calculating my age in dog years
let myName = 'Joshua'.toLowerCase();
//Assinging name variable
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
// Printing sentence explaining age relation


/*
console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);
*/
